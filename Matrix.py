# Matrix is a two dimensional array that contains the same elements as the vector

# Matrix arithmetic to perform operations
# Addition, Scalar multiplication of a matrix, matrix multiplication

# Matrix addition
# Verify that the matrices are of the same dimensions
# Make sure we add elements in the correct corresponding index

# Matrix multiplication
# To multiply a matrix by a scalar, we do not need to verify
# Dimensions or
# Indices

# Multiplication of a square matrices
# When multiplying 2 matrices we need to consider the dimensions of each, as multiplication is not possible if the dimensions are not aligned appropriately.
# The easiest multiplication to consider is that of two square matrices of the same dimensions nnxnn.
