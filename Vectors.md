# Vectors = ordered list of numbers
# each element in the vector (component/ coordinate) is a number
# vectors can have n elements and be in the field of Real Numbers

# To calculate the direction of the movement of a vector, we use an angle

# Vector Transpose
# Column vector:
```
[a1
 a2
 a3]
```

# vectors can be represented as a row vector
[a1, a2, a3]


Transpose: It's as if one vector was actually tilted by 90 degrees.

Each vector holds the magnitutde as well as the direction of the momvemnt
|| ||: symbol used for magnitude

# We use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude of a @d vector

In the specific angle illustrated below \thetaθ is calculated the following way:

theta = tan ^ -1 (y/x)

# The above operations satisfy the field axioms:
- Associativity
- Commutativity
- Distributivity
- Identity (defining zero addition and multiplication by one)
- Inverse (defining Subtraction-Additive Inverse and Division-Multiplicative Inverse)

# Multiplying by Vector
(Notice that each element of the vector is multiplied by the same scalar alpha).

# (a) The magnitude is:
\alpha * \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
# (b) Will the direction change?
no
# (c) The direction will change by
180
# (d) The magnitude will:
decrease
