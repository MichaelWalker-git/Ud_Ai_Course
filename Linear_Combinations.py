# linear combination is a multiplication of a scalar to a variable
# Multiplication of a scalar to a variable

# x y z are variables
# a_1, a_2, a_3 are scalars
# A linear combination of a scalar by a vector will be a new vector:
#
# \vec{v}=a_1\vec{x}+a_2\vec{y}+a_3\vec{z}

# A combination of a scalar * vector => vecot

# What is a span?
# Vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors

# Quiz
# v_1 = [1 2 3]
# v_2 = [2 2 2]
# v_3 = [8 8 8]

# one vector can be defined as a lienar combination of the other
# v_2 = 0.25 (v_3)

# linear combination, we do not need v_3
# if we use v_3 as part of our linear combination ( we do not need v_2)
# Therefor to define the plane spanned by linear combination of the vectors

# When one vector can be defined as a linear combination of the other vectors, they are linearly dependent vectors

# When each vector in a set of vectors, vector can not be defined as a linear combination of the other vectors they are
# a set of linearly independent vectors

# Simplified set of equations
# x = [-14 2]
# y = [5 -1]
#
# z = [-13 3]

# -14a + 5b = -13
# 2a - b = 3

# Two unknowns can be solved by:
# Graphical method
# Substituion method
# Elimination method

# Graphing solution
# Draw both lines (linear plots) and find the intersection
# The intersection is the solution to (a,b)

# Substitution
# Isolate a variable from one of the equations and substitue it in the scond
# Method will reduce our system of equations ot a single equation with a single unknown

# -14a + 5b = -13
# 2a - b = 3 ==> b = 2a -3

# -14a + 5(2a -3) = -13
b = -4

# ELIMINATION
# Elimnate one of the variable by enforcing the same absolute  value to one of the scalars( coefficients)Michael Tran - m0t010b
# -14a + 5b = -13
#   2a -  b =   3

# -14a + 5b = -13
#  10a - 5b =   15

# 4a = 2 => a = 1/2
b = -4

# Will a set of two linear equations with two unknowns always have a solution? And if so, will it always be a single solution?

# A: There are infinite number of solutions
